## Question
```text
# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: MAPPINGS AND TEXT ANALYSIS **
# GOAL: Create a mapping that satisfies a given set of requirements
# REQUIRED SETUP:
# (i) a running Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node
# and a Kibana instance,
# (ii) the cluster has no index with name `hamlet`,
# (iii) the cluster has no template that applies to indices
# starting by `hamlet`

# Create the index `hamlet_1` with one primary shard and no replicas
# Define a mapping for the default type "_doc" of `hamlet_1`, so
# that (i) the type has three fields, named `speaker`,
# `line_number`, and `text_entry`, (ii) `speaker` and
# `line_number` are unanalysed strings

# Update the mapping of `hamlet_1` by disabling aggregations on
# `line_number`

# Add some documents to `hamlet_1` by running the following _bulk
# commandPUT hamlet-1/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":0}}
{"line_number":"1.1.1","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Whos
there?"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":1}}
{"line_number":"1.1.2","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"Nay,
answer me: stand, and unfold yourself."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":2}}
{"line_number":"1.1.3","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Long live
the king!"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":3}}
{"line_number":"1.2.1","speaker":"KING CLAUDIUS","text_entry":"Though
yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet_1","_id":4}}
{"line_number":"1.2.2","speaker":"KING CLAUDIUS","text_entry":"The
memory be green, and that it us befitted"}

# Create the index `hamlet_2` with one primary shard and no replicas
# Copy the mapping of `hamlet_1` into `hamlet_2`, but also define a
# multi-field for `speaker`. The name of such multi-field is
# `tokens` and its data type is the (default) analysed string
# Reindex `hamlet_1` to `hamlet_2`
# Verify that full-text queries on "speaker.tokens" are enabled on
# `hamlet_2` by running the following command: GET hamlet_2/_search
{
 "query": {
 "match": { "speaker.tokens": "hamlet" }
}}
