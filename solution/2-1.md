# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: CLUSTER ADMINISTRATION **
# GOAL: Allocate the shards in a way that satisfies a given set of
# requirements
# REQUIRED SETUP: /
# Download the exam version of Elasticsearch
# Deploy the cluster `eoc-06-cluster`, with three nodes named
# `node1`, `node2`, and `node3`
# Configure the Zen Discovery module of each node so that they can
# communicate
# Start the cluster
# Create the index `hamlet-1` with two primary shards and one
# replica
# Add some documents to `hamlet-1` by running the command below PUT
hamlet-1/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":0}}
{"line_number":"1","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Whos there?"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":1}}
{"line_number":"2","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"Nay, answer me:
stand, and unfold yourself."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":2}}
{"line_number":"3","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Long live the
king!"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":3}}
{"line_number":"4","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"Bernardo?"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":4}}
{"line_number":"5","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"He."}

# Create the index `hamlet-2` with two primary shard and one replica
# Add some documents to `hamlet-2` by running the command belowPUT
hamlet-2/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-2","_id":5}}
{"line_number":"6","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"You come most
carefully upon your hour."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-2","_id":6}}
{"line_number":"7","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Tis now struck
twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-2","_id":7}}
{"line_number":"8","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"For this relief
much thanks: tis bitter cold,"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-2","_id":8}}
{"line_number":"9","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"And I am sick at
heart."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-2","_id":9}}
{"line_number":"10","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Have you had quiet
guard?"}

# Check that the replicas of indices `hamlet-1` and `hamlet-2` have
# been allocated
# Check the distribution of primary shards and replicas of indices
# `hamlet-1` and `hamlet-2` across the nodes of the cluster

# Configure `hamlet-1` to allocate both primary shards to `node2`,
# using the node name
# Verify the success of the last action by using the _cat API
# Configure `hamlet-2` so that no primary shard is allocated to
# `node3`
# Verify the success of the last action by using the _cat API
# Remove any allocation filter setting associated with `hamlet-1`
# and `hamlet-2`

# Let's assume that we deployed the `eoc-06-cluster` cluster across
# two availability zones, named `earth` and `mars`. Add the
# attribute `AZ` to the nodes configuration, and set its value
# to "earth" for `node1` and `node2`, and to "mars" for `node3`
# Restart the cluster
# Configure the cluster to force shard allocation awareness based on
# the two availability zones, and persist such configuration
# across cluster restarts
# Verify the success of the last action by using the _cat API

# Configure the cluster to reflect a hot/warm architecture, with
# `node1` as the only hot node
# Configure the `hamlet-1` index to allocate its shards only to warm
# nodes
# Verify the success of the last action by using the _cat API \
# Remove the hot/warm shard filtering configuration from the
# `hamlet-1` configuration
# Let's assume that the nodes have either a "large" or "small" local
# storage. Add the attribute `storage` to the nodes config, and
# set its value so that `node2` is the only with a "small"
# storage
# Configure the `hamlet-2` index to allocate its shards only to
# nodes with a large storage size
# Verify the success of the last action by using the _cat API

## Knowledge points
```text
index.routing.allocation.include.{attribute}
Assign the index to a node whose {attribute} has at least one of the comma-separated values.
index.routing.allocation.require.{attribute}
Assign the index to a node whose {attribute} has all of the comma-separated values.
index.routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}
Assign the index to a node whose {attribute} has none of the comma-separated values.

## Some can't answer
* 移除index shard filter(√)
* 只将分片放在warm节点上(√)
* "cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.AZ.values": ["earth", "mars"] 是否必须配置
