## Question
```text
# Create the index template `hamlet_template`, so that the template
# (i) matches any index that starts by "hamlet_" or "hamlet-",
# (ii) allocates one primary shard and no replicas for each 
# matching index
# Create the indices `hamlet2` and `hamlet_test`
# Verify that only `hamlet_test` applies the settings defined in
# `hamlet_template`

# Update `hamlet_template` by defining a mapping for the type
# "_doc", so that (i) the type has three fields, named `speaker`,
# `line_number`, and `text_entry`, (ii) `text_entry` uses an
# "english" analyzer

# Verify that the updates in `hamlet_template` did not apply to the
# existing indices
# In one request, delete both `hamlet2` and `hamlet_test`
# Create the index `hamlet-1` and add some documents by running the
# following _bulk commandPUT hamlet-1/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":0}}
{"line_number":"1.1.1","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Whos
there?"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":1}}
{"line_number":"1.1.2","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"Nay,
answer me: stand, and unfold yourself."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":2}}
{"line_number":"1.1.3","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Long live
the king!"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet-1","_id":3}}
{"line_number":"1.2.1","speaker":"KING CLAUDIUS","text_entry":"Though
yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death"}
# Verify that the mapping of `hamlet-1` is consistent with what defined
in `hamlet_template`

# Update `hamlet_template` so as to reject any document having a
# field that is not defined in the mapping
# Verify that you cannot index the following document in `hamlet-1` 
PUT hamlet-1/_doc
{
 "author": "Shakespeare"
} 
# Update `hamlet_template` so as to enable dynamic mapping again
# Update `hamlet_template` so as to (i) dynamically map to an
# integer any field that starts by "number_", (ii) dynamically
# map to unanalysed text any string field
# Create the index `hamlet-2` and add a document by running the
# following commandPOST hamlet-2/_doc/4
{
 "text_entry": "With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?",
 "line_number": "3.1.4",
 "number_act": "3",
 "speaker": "KING CLAUDIUS"
}# Verify that the mapping of `hamlet-2` is consistent with what
# defined in `hamlet_template`
