# Create the security role `francisco_role` in the native realm, so # that:
# (i) the role has "monitor" privileges on the cluster,
# (ii) the role has all privileges on the `hamlet` index
# Create the user `francisco` with password "francisco-password"
# Assign the role `francisco_role` to the `francisco` user
# Login using the `francisco` user credentials, and run queries on
# `hamlet` to verify that the role privileges were correctly set

# Create the security role `bernardo_role` in the native realm, so
# that:
# (i) the role has "monitor" privileges on the cluster,
# (ii) the role has read-only privileges on the `hamlet` index,
# (iii) the role can see only those documents having "BERNARDO"
# as a `speaker`,
# (iv) the role can see only the `text_entry` field
# Create the user `bernardo` with password "bernardo-password"
# Assign the role `bernardo_role` to the `bernardo` user
# Login using the `bernardo` user credentials, and run queries on
# `hamlet` to verify that the role privileges were correctly set

# Change the password of the `bernardo` user to "poor-bernardo"
