## Question
```text
# Create the index `hamlet-raw` with 1 primary shard and 3 replicas

# Add a document to `hamlet-raw`, so that the document (i) has id
# "1", (ii) has default type, (iii) has one field named `line`
# with value "To be, or not to be: that is the question"

# Update the document with id "1" by adding a field named
# `line_number` with value "3.1.64"
# Add a new document to `hamlet-raw`, so that the document (i) has
# the id automatically assigned by Elasticsearch, (ii) has
# default type, (iii) has a field named `text_entry` with value
# "Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer", (iv) has a field
# named `line_number` with value "3.1.66"
# Update the last document by setting the value of `line_number` to
# "3.1.65"
# In one request, update all documents in `hamlet-raw` by adding a
# new field named `speaker` with value "Hamlet"

# Update the document with id "1" by renaming the field `line` into
# `text_entry`

# Create the index `hamlet` and add some documents by running the
# following _bulk commandPUT hamlet/_doc/_bulk

# Create a script named `set_is_hamlet` and save it into the cluster
# state. The script (i) adds a field named `is_hamlet` to each
# document, (ii) sets the field to "true" if the document has
# `speaker` equals to "HAMLET", (iii) sets the field to "false"
# otherwise
# Update all documents in `hamlet` by running the `set_is_hamlet`
# script

# Remove from `hamlet` the documents that have either "KING
# CLAUDIUS" or "LAERTES" as the value of `speaker`
